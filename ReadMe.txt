This web site provides examples for ITC 172 Assignment 3

The example does more than the assignment requires. 
* The Master Page contains a simple menu and a h1 formatted with CSS
* Example 1 uses the UpdateManager and Timer controls to put a clock in an Ajax div.
* Example 2 is the closest to the actual assignment. It uses the scriptManager and JavaScript
to access the web service, pass it values and retrieve a result. The web service is a bit
more complicated than the assignment requires.
* the third example shows how to access the web service through C#.
* The CSS style sheet contains 3 classes and formatting for the h1 element
